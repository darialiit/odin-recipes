        <h2>Description</h2>
        <p>Anyone else remember / indulge in / thoroughly enjoy that popular frozen White Lasagna entree as a kid? Well I’ll tell ya, I most certainly did. My family didn’t have it often, but whenever we did it was a treat.</p>
        <p>This Vegetable Lasagna is my interpretation of that meal, buuuut has a tiny bit of an upgrade. Not only is it drastically healthier than the original version, but it’s also Gluten-Free, Dairy-Free, and Vegan!</p>
        <p>It all starts with a basic Homemade White Sauce, a yummy Vegetable filling, and some homemade Vegan Ricotta. Then we’ll layer all that with some Gluten-Free Lasagna noodles (which are available in most grocery stores), top it off with some GF Breadcrumbs, and pop that baby in the oven! Let everything cook together for about an hour, and you’re left with this bubbly, hearty, and cozy goodness. I mean….those layers! The crunchy breadcrumbs! The chewy bits of lasagna noodles on the bottom! I’m drooling just thinking about it…</p>
        <h3>Ingredients</h3>
        <h4>For the White Sauce:</h4>
        <ul>
            <li>2 tbsp cup Brown Rice Flour</li>
            <li>Nutritional Yeast</li>
            <li>6 cup Unsweetened Soy Milk</li>
            <li>tsp Nutmeg</li>
            <li>tsp Salt</li>
            <li>Pinch of Cayenne or Red Pepper (Optional)</li>
        </ul>
        <h4>For the Vegetable Filling:</h4>
        <ul>
            <li>1 small Yellow Onion, diced</li>
            <li>2 tsp Vegetable Bouillon Paste</li>
            <li>4 cups Broccoli Florets, finely diced</li>
            <li>2 cups Carrot, julienned (I used store-bought)</li>
            <li>5 oz Baby Spinach</li>
        </ul>
        <h2>Steps</h2>
        <ol>
            <li> Prep all of your produce and ingredients, then preheat the oven to 425F.</li>

            <li>First, Prep the White Sauce. Add the Nutritional Yeast and Brown Rice Flour to a large pot and toast over Medium Heat for 3-4 minutes, stirring occasionally. Once toasted, add in the remaining Sauce ingredients and whisk well. Bring the mixture to a boil over high heat, then reduce the heat back to medium and cook for 3-4 minutes, until thickened. Set Aside</li>
            <li>In the meantime, prep the Vegetable Filling. Add the diced Onion to a large pan with a splash of water or oil and sauté over medium heat, until translucent. Add the Smoked Paprika and Vegetable Bouillon paste to the pan along with the Carrots and a splash of water; sauté for an additional 1-2 minutes. Then, add the Broccoli, Spinach, Basil, and cook until the Spinach has wilted, approximately 1-2 minutes.</li>
            <li>Pour 1 cup of the White Sauce into the base of a 9″ x 13″ baking dish and spread it around evenly. Add 1 layer of Lasagna Noodles to the bottom of the dish, making sure they overlap slightly.</li>

            <li>Add half of the Vegan Ricotta to the top of the Noodles and use a spatula to spread it around evenly. Pour half of the cooked Vegetables over the Ricotta, then evenly spread 1 cup of White Sauce on top of the Vegetables. Repeat this step once again, using up the remainder of the Ricotta and Vegetables.</li>
            <li>Top the second layer off with a final layer of Noodles, then pour the remainder of the White Sauce over the Lasagna. Evenly sprinkle the Breadcrumbs over the top, then cover the baking dish with tin foil.</li>
            <li>Bake for 40 minutes covered, then 15 minutes uncovered. Remove the Lasagna from the oven and let rest for 10 minutes before slicing and serving. Store any leftovers in the fridge for up to one week.</li>
        </ol>
